> [!NOTE] Lore
> There had been legends and tales of enormous Bats living deep within the Caverns of Nathuz, but until the invasion of the monsters none had ever seen such beasts. But now with the arrival of the Golems, the Bats have started to pour out of the caves at night to plague the neighboring countryside.
> Unlike normal harmless bats, these giant Bats arenâ€™t very peaceful
