> [!NOTE] Lore
> Deep down under the mountain, hidden in the Ilrion Catacombs, the dreaded Vampire Lord sits on his sumptuous throne. In his underground prison he holds captive the King of Ennon. It is said that like a flash the Vampire Lord is able to disappear in a cloud of smoke - only to reappear out of thin air and attack by surprise. Legends also tell of strange sightings of a giant, bat-shaped shadow seen passing over IIrion on brightly moonlit nights.
