> [!NOTE] Lore
> Vicious and sneaky, the Goblin Warriors make up the majority of the Goblin army. What they lack in strength they make up in numbers. Wherever you see one there are sure to be more around, waiting to ambush unsuspecting victims. They are cowardly however and prefer to attack if they outnumber their foes.
