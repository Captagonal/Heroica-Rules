The Goblins are the most numerous of all the threatening evil in Ennon, holding about 3 out of and 7 soldiers in the kingdom and surrounding areas to this point.  The average Goblin may be weak, but they are lead by two horrific monsters, the Goblin King and his Goblin General.  Besides having completely conquered and inhabited Castle Fortaan, they now control Draida Bay, Ennon's only sea port, blocking off nearly all help from Drandora.
