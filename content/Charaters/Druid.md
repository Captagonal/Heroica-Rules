> The Druid comes from a line of ancient beings known as "Druids," who lived in an ancient temple in Waldurk Forest. When the [[Dark Druid]] took over, this Druid was the only one who remained in the forest, where he meditated for long days.  Learning the ways of nature, he became able to heal himself from any wound.
