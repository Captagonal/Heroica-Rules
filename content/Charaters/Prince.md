> The Prince is a young swordsman from [[Castle Fortaan]], son of the King and mentored by the [[Sage]].  The grief of losing his father nearly drove him mad, but when the [[Wizard]] came with the intention of rescuing the King, the [[Sage]] unable to persuade him to stay in safety.  From the urge to regain his father to the excitement of adventure, the young Prince is perhaps the most steadfast and determined of all the heroes.
