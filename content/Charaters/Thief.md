> The Thief originates from [[Drandora Port|Drandora]], the last free city in the world surrounding Ennon.  He was born homeless, and he stole to survive.  With the arising evil, the Thief wishes to use his survival skills to prove to himself that he can do good, so he ventures into the [[Caverns of Nathuz]] to defeat the dreaded [[Golem Lord]].
