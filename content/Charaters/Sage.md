> [!NOTE] Lore
> The Sage is from the Kingdom of Ennon, and he lived in [[Castle Fortaan]] as the King's Advisor for many years.  When the castle was invaded and the King captured, he took it upon himself to mentor and protect the [[Prince]].  This ancient man takes up a different form of magic than the [[Druid]] or the [[Wizard]], and because his magic does not affect the living, he has no need for any object with which concentrate his magic; he needs only to read the spell from his book.
