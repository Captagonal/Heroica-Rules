----
Since the dark forces settled upon the land, farmers have struggled to maintain their livelihood. Monsters constantly ravage the fields and destroy most of the crops, and what is left is barely enough for families to survive. There is no longer enough to trade, and even if there was, the [[Goblin General|Goblin General's]] siege on [[Draida Bay]] makes it impossible to sell or buy anything. Prospects are grim.
It's up to you to locate the Catacombs, fight your way past vicious [[Bat|bats]] and lumbering [[Zombie|Zombies]], and defeat the [[Vampire Lord]] to rescue the King!
