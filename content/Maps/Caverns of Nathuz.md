![[Caverns of Nathuz.jpg|600]]

------
These mystical caverns stretch deep into the belly of the dark mountains of Nathuz. The web of secret pathways once served as a passageway for smugglers between [[Draida Bay]] and the [[Barresh Settlements]].  
Now the [[Golem Lord]] is raising his army here. And the [[Bat|Giant Bats]] that have lived in the darkest corners of the caves for aeons have woken from their slumber to wreak havoc on the land.
