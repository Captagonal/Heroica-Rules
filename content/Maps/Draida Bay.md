---
Draida Bay is controlled by the merciless [[Goblin General]]. Most traffic that passes in or out of the kingdom has to cross through this port. The bay is named after the Queen Draida who lost her young son here centuries ago. The legend says she went mad with grief. She convinced a wizard to turn her into a sea creature so she could find her son and bring him back to life. The wizard warned her, if she did not find him, she would remain a sea creature for all eternity. She never returned.
