When the Kingdom of Ennon fell, The [[Goblin King]] claimed the castle as the strongest possible fortress for himself and his Goblin Army. The once so magnificent home of noble kings, queens and knights now echoes with the howls and growls of dark monsters. The whereabouts of the true king is still unknown.
