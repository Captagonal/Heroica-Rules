![[Waldurk Forest.jpg|600]]

---
The oldest trees in the forest are more than 1,000 years old. Many years ago, the Druids lived here in an ancient temple. Shrouded in mystery, they passed on their wisdom from generation to generation. One druid was corrupted by power, and turned into a force of evil. The temple has now decayed into ruins where the [[Dark Druid]] and his secrets are guarded by fierce [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. Most animals fled along with the Druids. Other creatures, like the [[Spider|giant spiders]], are falling under the spell of the dark forces.

## Monsters:
[[Werewolf]]
[[Spider]]
